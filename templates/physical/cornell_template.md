## How to Use

1. **Fill notes section first** (right side)
   - Write detailed content from raw notes
   - Include examples and diagrams
   - Make connections between ideas

2. **Add cues in left column** (after reviewing)
   - Key terms to remember
   - Questions to test yourself
   - Important formulas

3. **Write summary last** (bottom)
   - Forces you to synthesize
   - 3-5 sentences max
   - Focus on "why it matters"

## Tips

- Draw a vertical line 2.5" from left edge
- Draw a horizontal line 2" from bottom
- Use different colors sparingly (optional)
- Cross-reference Jupyter notebooks when relevant
- Review by covering notes section, quiz from cues
