# Raw Capture Symbols

Make your selection of symbols and format and write these on the inside front cover of your notebooks.  
*pro tip: also fill out a notecard you can also use as placeholder/reference.*

## Symbol Reference

Ideally the symbols are simple and analogous offline → digital (markdown) for consistency and continuity.
```

## Tips

- **Consistent use** matters more than perfect use
- **Mark as you write**, don't add symbols later
- **Don't overthink** - when in doubt, use `•`
- **Cross out date** when page is processed
