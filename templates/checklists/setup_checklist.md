# Setup Checklist

Use this checklist when first implementing the ETL Learning System.

## Physical Materials

- [ ] **A5 notebook** for raw capture (portable size)
- [ ] **B5 notebook** for refined Cornell notes
- [ ] **Pens** that you like writing with
- [ ] **Sticky tabs** for marking pages
- [ ] **Optional:** Highlighters (1-2 colors max)

## Write in Notebooks

### A5 Raw Capture (Inside Front Cover)
- [ ] Symbol reference
- [ ] Header format
- [ ] "After processing: Cross out date"

### B5 Cornell (Inside Front Cover)
- [ ] Cornell method template
- [ ] Three-section layout guide

## Digital Setup

- [ ] **Create learning repository** on GitHub
- [ ] **Install Jupyter**: `pip install jupyter`
- [ ] **Copy templates** to your repo
- [ ] **Set up directory structure**
```
  courses/
  projects/
  exercises/
  templates/
  docs/
  resources/
```

## Test Run

- [ ] **Capture one day** of notes in A5
- [ ] **Process one page** to test workflow
- [ ] **Create one notebook** from template
- [ ] **Update one doc page**
- [ ] **Commit to GitHub**

## Weekly Routine

- [ ] **Print weekly checklist** (or write in notebook)
- [ ] **Choose processing day** (Sunday or Monday)
- [ ] **Set 90-min calendar block** for processing
- [ ] **First processing session** completed

## Adjustments

After first week, adjust:
- [ ] Symbol set (if needed)
- [ ] Processing time/day
- [ ] Template structure
- [ ] Anything that felt clunky

Remember: Start simple, adjust as you go!
