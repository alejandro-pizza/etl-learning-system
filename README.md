# ETL Learning System

> A comprehensive note-taking and knowledge management system designed for left handed graduate students, particularly those with ADHD. Based on the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) data pipeline metaphor.

## Philosophy

This system addresses common challenges in graduate education:
- **Information overload** during lectures and readings
- **Scattered notes** that are never reviewed
- **Decision paralysis** about where to write things
- **Inconsistency** in note-taking methods
- **Poor retention** of material, important dates, and tasks

**Solution:** A streamlined, three-stage workflow that separates capture from processing, minimizes decisions, and creates both physical and digital reference materials.

## System Overview
```
EXTRACT (Capture)          TRANSFORM (Process)        LOAD (Store)
───────────────────        ───────────────────        ───────────────────
Raw notebook          →    Weekly sessions       →    Refined notes
- Chronological            • 60-90 minutes            • Cornell method
- Minimal structure        • Format decisions         • Jupyter notebooks
- Zero friction            • Refinement               • Knowledge base
```

### The Three Stages

**1. EXTRACT (During the Week)**
- Capture everything in one A5 notebook chronologically
- Use simple symbols: `• □ ? * > !`
- Date header format: `[DATE] | [TYPE] | [SOURCE]`
- No organization, no decisions - just write

**2. TRANSFORM (Sunday/Monday)**
- 60-90 minute weekly processing session
- Scan raw notes, mark pages with sticky tabs
- Decide: Code-heavy? → Jupyter. Conceptual? → Cornell.
- Process notes using templates

**3. LOAD (Storage)**
- **Physical:** B5 Cornell notebook for concepts/theory
- **Digital:** Jupyter notebooks for code/examples
- **Knowledge base:** Markdown docs with course summaries

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- One notebook (raw capture) *A5 preferred*
- One notebook (refined notes) *B5 preferred*
- One nice pen
- GitHub account
- Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter`)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone this repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/etl-learning-system.git
```

2. **Copy templates to your learning repo:**
```bash
   cp -r templates/ ~/your-learning-repo/
```

3. **Read the guides:**
   - [Complete Workflow Guide](guides/WORKFLOW.md)
   - [Physical Note-Taking Guide](guides/PHYSICAL_NOTES.md)
   - [Digital Note-Taking Guide](guides/DIGITAL_NOTES.md)
   - [Knowledge Base Setup](guides/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md)

4. **Print the weekly checklist:**

## Who This Is For

- Graduate students managing multiple courses
- People with ADHD who struggle with organization
- Anyone overwhelmed by scattered notes
- Students who want to retain more information
- Technical students who need both code and concept notes

---

## Key Features

### For ADHD Brains
- **Single capture point** - one funnel, no decisions about "which notebook"
- **Simple symbols** - consistent, intuitive, minimal choices
- **Chronological only** - no complex categorization
- **Processing ritual** - structured weekly session
- **Visual completion** - cross out processed pages/sections

### For Learning
- **Writing by hand** - better retention during capture
- **Spaced repetition** - weekly processing reinforces learning
- **Multiple formats** - concepts in Cornell, code in Jupyter
- **Knowledge base** - searchable reference for future use
- **Version control** - track your learning development over time

### For Technical Content
- **Jupyter templates** - structured code documentation
- **Git integration** - professional portfolio building
- **Markdown docs** - cross-referenced knowledge base
- **Tool references** - quick lookup for Docker, Git, etc.

## Customization

This system is designed to be adapted. Common modifications:

**Symbols:** Adjust the symbol set to meet your needs +|-
**Timing:** Process on different days if Sunday/Monday doesn't work
**Tools:** Use VS Code instead of Jupyter, Obsidian instead of markdown
**Scope:** Start with just school notes, expand to other life areas later
